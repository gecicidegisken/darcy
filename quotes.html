        This could be a blog, a portfolio or anything you dare to imagine. For
        now there will be a selection of my famous quotes.

      <blockquote class="quote">
        “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me, and I am in no
        humor at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by
        other men.”
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        “Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride - where there is a real
        superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what
        they were last April, tell me so at once."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">"I love you. Most Ardently."</blockquote>
