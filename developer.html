        Hi there! I'm glad you made it here :) My name is Hilal and I'm the
        developer of Mr. Darcy's terminal themed web page. The site is open
        source on GitHub and I'll provide a link to the repo in a minute.
        <br />
        I made this site just to try and see if I can. There could be any other
        types of pages depending on the needs of the owner. It may be a good
        idea to have a website like this if you know that your audience is
        mostly developers or computer
        <i style="font-weight: 300">geeks.</i> However, in any other
        possibilities having a GUI with beautiful colors and
        <b> CLICKABLE </b> links is kind of a must. :) <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Get in touch with me and see my other projects ->
